## Formatting

CSS gives you a lot of flexibility when it comes to how you write it. The following are completely up to your personal preference:

* whitespace (indentation, line breaks, etc)
* id and class names (the names themselves, using hyphens, undercores, camel casing, etc)
* selector ordering
* rule ordering

There's no right way in regards to these items, but I recommend following these rules:

* Be consistent. Use the same indentation, the same id and class naming conventions, and the same selector and rule ordering conventions throughout your CSS. If you are working on an existing project, figure out the conventions already in use and stick to them, even if they are not your own personal preferences.
* Aim for readability. Though it's possible to put all of your CSS rules on one line, it really hampers readability. Use whitespace thoughtfully to aid readability.

## Floats

I will again defer to CSS Tricks for a better [explanation of CSS floats](http://css-tricks.com/all-about-floats/) than I could write up.

Here's a [good article](http://designshack.net/articles/css/whats-the-deal-with-display-inline-block/) on an alternative to floats by using `display: inline-block`.

## Image Sprites

[This article](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/04/27/the-mystery-of-css-sprites-techniques-tools-and-tutorials/) does a good job of explaining CSS sprites and links to a bunch of other articles and resources about them.

Here's the [jsbin I wrote up](http://jsbin.com/nuquva/1/edit?html,css,output) in class to demonstrate image sprites.
