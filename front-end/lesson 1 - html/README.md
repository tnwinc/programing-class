# Lesson 1 - HTML

[Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) is a great resource for learning about and referencing HTML. When searching the web for something related to front end technologies, prefix it with 'mdn,' like `mdn h1 tag`. Avoid w3schools, it's not a very good resource.

[jsbin](http://jsbin.com) is a great way to play around with HTML and get a live preview of what you are creating.

Read [MDN's Intro to HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Introduction) for a better lesson on HTML than I could write here.
